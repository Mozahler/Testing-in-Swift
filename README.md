# Testing-in-Swift
Pragmatic Approaches to TDD, UITesting and Playground-Driven Development
#  Pragmatic UITesting, Playgrounds and TDD

&nbsp;

It took me a while to immerse myself in the UITesting world - mostly because my fundamental IDE is in a permanent state of flux. Xcode makes solving so many tedious tasks a button click away, but you can still find yourself at a loss when it loses track of where it is...

I don't want you to become discouraged and give up - as I did more than once...  So I hope these **"Celebrity Testimonials"** will help convince you to "stay the course" and break through those initial roadblocks to successful UI testing and **Test-Driven Development**

## Coding Celebrities and What They Have to Say About UITesting
&nbsp;

### Florian Kugler and Chris Eidhof
SwiftTalk <https://talk.objc.io>  
  
Incremental Programming <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcqWlEaw58M>  

Hands-Down this is my favorite VLog. I can't recommend SwiftTalk enough.  Check it out - watch a few of the free videos to get a feel for their approach. What I most enjoy about their approach is they promote a process.  Get an idea down, express it in code, verify it works, make it more flexible/useful and clean things up so it can be reused. Nothing is ever written in stone.


### Chris Eidhof and Brandon Williams
Playground Driven Development <https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E51-playground-driven-development>

Here's a great example of a SwiftTalk episode with a guest speaker.  Brandon explains the benefits of using Playgrounds for quick updates of UI layout with immediate visual confirmation. He makes a convincing argument for adding Playgrounds to your bag of tricks.

### Paul Hudson
UI Testing Cheat Sheet <https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/148/xcode-ui-testing-cheat-sheet>

My hunch is that Paul gets about three hours of sleep a day. I just don't see how he can get so much done, otherwise. A hallmark of his work is that he constantly brings his products up to date. And he explains things very well.

### Chris Eidhof and Lisa Luo
Test Drive Development <https://talk.objc.io/episodes/S01E53-test-driven-reactive-programming>

To me, this is a subversive video... Lisa not only knows her stuff, but it's clear she enjoys sharing what she knows! She and Brandon (see above and below) were instrumental in helping me overcome the inital roadblocks.

### John Sundell
Pragmatic Testing <https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-swift/>  

Refactoring for Testability <https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/refactoring-swift-code-for-testability/>  

John, like Chris and Paul, is constantly dabbling and sharing - and always enthusiastically!
He makes periodic visits to conferences and I see updates from him on Reddit a few times a week. He (and a few others on this page) deserve a fuller write-up. It's on my to-do list.

### Brandon Williams
The Two Sides of Writing Testable Code <https://academy.realm.io/posts/try-swift-brandon-williams-writing-testable-code/>

"I only write code if it can be tested. It’s a great boundary to force myself to write code in a functional style if it can be tested. And I’ve slowly started to think of my test code as the actual code that I care about, that the important work I do, not the implementation."

### Ash Furrow
An Artsy Testing Tour <https://academy.realm.io/posts/tryswift-ash-furrow-artsy-testing-tour/>

 - nothing is ever perfect.
 - nothing is ever complete.
 - sometimes we have to write code that’s not ideal and that’s ok
